# Reinforcement_Learning


Tic_Tac_Toe:

An AI learning to play Tic_Tac_Toe from the experience. After ca. 10000 games the AI is playing really well and if trained further becomes unbeatable. The AI plays against its counterpart and saves the learning progress in excel files 1.xlsx and 2.xlsx. If wanted the AI can read from the existing files and thus immediately become trained and ready for testing. The excel files attached contain examples of unbeatable AI. There is a module allowing a human player to test the AI skills in a game PvC mode. Alternatively, you can just display up to 10 consecutinve runs of AI vs AI matches and see each step of these games for yourself. 

The AI learning  process is based on decaying epsilon-greedy concept along with unconventional reward system for effective defence.
