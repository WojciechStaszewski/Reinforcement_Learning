Tic_Tac_Toe:

An AI machine learning to play Tic_Tac_Toe from the experience. After ca. 10000 games the AI is playing really well and if trained further becomes unbeatable. AI plays against its counterpart and saves the results of learning in excel files 1.xlsx and 2.xlsx. Therefore, AI can also read from the existing files and thus gain his skills faster. The excel files attached contain examples of unbeatable AI. There is a module allowing a human player to test the AI skills in a game or few or an option to display up to 10 games in which AI play against its counterpart.

The learning AI process is based on decaying epsilon-greedy concept along with unconventional reward system for defending against the opponent.
